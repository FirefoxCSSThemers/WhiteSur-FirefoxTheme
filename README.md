# WhiteSur Tweaked Theme
> A Firefox theme made to simulate Safari on macOS Big Sur 11. Works best on Proton.

### Compatibility
> This release was tested on the following platforms (only supports Firefox 70+):
> - Windows 10 (Home, Pro, Enterprise, LTSB, LTSC and Education)
> - Untested on macOS and Linux. This doesn't mean it won't work on these Operating Systems, this just means it isn't tested yet. If you want to contribute, please test it on any of these and fill in an issue with the distro you use or the macOS version it was tested on, and obviously the results.

### Manual Installation Steps
> Copy the `chrome` and `configuration` folders into your Firefox Profile directory. If you don't know where that is, try the following:
> 1. Go to `about:support` in Firefox.
> 2. Search for Application Basics, find Profile Directory and click on Open Directory.
> 3. Copy the folders mentioned above into the Profile folder. (usually has `-release` at the end).
> 4. This step is crucial. If you do it wrong, you can brick your Firefox installation.
>     1. Go to `about:config` in Firefox.
>     2. Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set it to `true` by clicking on the arrow button.
> 5. Restart Firefox.
> 6. You're done!

#### Note about Automated Installation
> We're working on an automated script to install the theme. It will be available on the `Releases` tab as soon as we finish it.
